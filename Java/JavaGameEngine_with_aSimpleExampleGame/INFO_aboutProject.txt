	- Other references/examples used in the project:
		>liunick's lwjgl3-engine: whttps://github.com/liunick/lwjgl3-engine

Future plans for the game engine (some of them):
	
	- Improve the existing physics engine
		>Improve collision detection
		>Improve collision response
		>Add event triggers
		>Give user possibility to test the physics engine
		   by changing physics engine settings
